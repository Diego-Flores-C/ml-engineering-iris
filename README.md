## Objective

The objective of this Repository is to publish a complete ML engineeering project for a common Data Science Problem.

## Which Problem?

The Iris problem, also known as the Iris dataset or Fisher's Iris dataset, is a classic multiclass classification problem in data science and machine learning. It was introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936.

* The Problem:
    The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample is described by four features:
        Sepal length
        Sepal width
        Petal length
        Petal width
    The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on these four features.

## What is a complete ML engineering project in this case?
